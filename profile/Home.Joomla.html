<h1 id="commserver-software-family">CommServer software family</h1>
<p>Welcome to a portal about innovative communication technologies. Here, you can find information about modern
    solutions in the field of software for communication and integration of computer systems. OPC technology – an
    international industrial communication standard - is a foundation for the proposed solutions.</p>
<p>CommServer is a software family to manage data transfer. Built-in technologies and algorithms provide an intelligent
    data transfer that automatically adapts communication parameters to the users or process needs. It is well suited to
    manage communication between applications, which combine the smart data transfer and systems integration
    functionality. It is optimally solution for the industrial process control, where the managed process is distributed
    over a large geographical area, e.g. heat and power distribution, oil and gas distribution, water and sanitation,
    multi-enterprise production, city road traffic supervision, control of water level and weather conditions, etc.</p>
<p>The CommServer software was written by CAS Lodz Poland. Now it is migrating to GitHub and publishing as the
    Open-source software (OSS). OSS is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in
    which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for
    any purpose. The separate project <a href="https://github.com/commsvr-com/migration2os">commsvr-com/migration2os</a>
    is being used to manage the migration process of transferring multi-parts software from an on-premise repository to
    a set of GitHub loosely coupled repositories. Further development of CommServer software will be carried out under a
    broader concept described in the following article</p>

<p>In the article, there is a call to action initiative. Consider joining. To get more, visit the section
    <code>How to be involved</code>.</p>
<p>I hope that thanks to this Partnership Program we will establish long term mutually beneficial cooperation.</p>
<p>In the following tables, the column GitHub contains links to appropriate GitHub repositories. At the top of each
    repository page, click on the <code>Watch</code> button if you want to watch selected projects that you're
    interested in. After that, you will get notifications about any activity at all on the project! Apparently, it is a
    signal for me to increase priority for planned work related to this repository. The family includes the following
    applications.</p>

                device communication channels throughput, a unique scan on demand algorithm was implemented. This OPC UA
                server can be used to wrap the Classic OPC DA server (DCOM based) and to create the Address Space based
                on the XML model file obtained from CAS Address Space Model Designer. (<a
